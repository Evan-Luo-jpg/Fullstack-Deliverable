# Could not upload all files cause there was too many so I only uploaded my app. The rest of the files should be the same as the bootcamp template. So uhh there is no backend. I still have no idea how to do a backend even after following the tutorial on the last day of bootcamp.

## How to use this repo

I guess download it and replace the template app with my app and hopefully it runs... At least it runs on my computer. For the backend, I just used the same template as bootcamp and firebase.
